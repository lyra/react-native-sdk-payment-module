## Prerequisites

In order to be able to perform a successful payment with our Mobile SDK you must have:

- A contract with your Payment service provider
- A deployed server capable to communicate with the payment platform, in order to verify data and create the payment session (please check out java server sample or the integration documentation for more information).
- Your public key to initialize the SDK. This key can be found in the merchant back-office in Settings -> Shop -> API -> REST API Keys
- Your REST API Server Name to initialize the SDK. This key can be found in the merchant back-office in Settings -> Shop -> API -> REST API Keys

Attention: The sdk and its dependencies must be installed as dynamic

## Documentation

Please check our documentation to understand how to integrate our SDK in your React Native application -> https://payzen.io/fr-FR/mobp/integration_guide/react_native/
